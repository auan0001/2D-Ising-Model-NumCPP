# 2D Ising Model NumCPP Implementation
## Running the simulations
This is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising Model in C++. The dependencies are NumCPP and CMake (for building, using GCC).
Build and compile the project by changing the the build directory

```
% cd build
% cmake ..
```

Running the binary with parameters $L=32$, $J=1$, $B=0$ using Metropolis-Hastings and saving the results in `run.dat`

```
./ISING 32 1.0 0.0 metropolis run.dat
```
If number of args are incorrect, the console will display

```
USAGE: <lattice dim> <J> <B> <metropolis/heatbath> <file>
```
